# Apple-Pie

Project completed as part of DPI's Swift Mobile App Development Course

The app is a game similar to Hang Man in that the user tries to guess a word by selecting a letter they think might be in the word.

The user wins the round when they guess the word correctly before running out of apples and moves to the next round.

The user loses the round when they run out of apples and did not guess the word correctly and moves to the next round
